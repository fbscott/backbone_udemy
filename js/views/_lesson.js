/******************************************************************************
 * A Backbone view is not the page in the browser.
 * It's the object responsible for rendering the content of the view as well
 * as responding to DOM events.
 *
 * Notes:
 *     $el = jQuery case object that contains the view's DOM element (div by
 *           default).
 *     el  = The DOM element in the markup to which the view's DOM element will
 *           attach. It is owned by the view.
 *           
 *     This view is responsible for rendering the content and responding to DOM
 *     events registered to it.
 *           
 * DOM dependencies:
 * - #js-spa-container
